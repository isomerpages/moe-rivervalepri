Primary 4 Booster
=================

In grooming our Riverlite leaders Â to become leaders who are committed, confident and have compassion, the Confidence Booster for P4 Programme was conducted for our students during term 2. Throughout this programme, our student leaders were exposed to reflect critically by discussing the challenges of public speaking as they will be representing the school as ambassadors. The 3 main objectives to be achieved at the end of the programme was to be APPROACHEABLE, KNOWLEDGEABLE and most importantly, CONFIDENT when approaching the public.

Students reflecting the challenges faced during public speaking. After presenting their speech in front of their teams, they had to reflect on the common issues related to speaking publicly they face earlier.This was vital as students had to think critically and had to take perspectives in becoming a better speaker

Students were given checklists to evaluate peers' proficiency in speaking publicly and constructive feedbacks were shared within groups. This helps our student leaders in learning their strengths and weaknesses

Teachers took the lead by role-modeling before the student leaders took the lead in presenting to their peers. They were given opportunities to practice, memorise and present their speeches while their teams evaluate and give constructive feedback for them to improve.. Along with public speaking videos and role-modelling by our teachers, our student leaders were able to display resilience and recognise the importance of being self-aware. This allows them to work harmoniously with their peers. The importance of reducing food wastage was also incorporated into this programme to prepare our student leaders for the Community Outreach program in Term 3.
