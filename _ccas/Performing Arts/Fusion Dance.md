####  BRIEF OVERVIEW

Contemporary Dance encompasses different dance forms and it is open to interpretation. Over the years, dancers have learnt different dance forms ranging from ballet to abstract dance. Since 2009, Rivervale had decided to focus on the genre of Hip Hop, in keeping with the objective of exposing pupils to different dance forms.
