**Mission**

To achieve excellence in playing instruments through teamwork  

**Vision**

To develop a life-long love for playing instruments  

**Brief Overview**

The Brass Band program aims to equip pupils with ensemble skills and develop them to become accomplished performers. Foundational training starts from P1 to P3, where students will learn music theory and instrumental playing skills. P4 to P6 pupils will further hone their musical techniques and ensemble playing skills. Performances are organized for pupils to showcase their learning and to build their confidence of performing for an audience. Such opportunities provide pupils with valuable performance experiences with their fellow band members and enhance their appreciation of music.
