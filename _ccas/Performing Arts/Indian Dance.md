**Mission** 

To enlighten audience with classically rooted programmes.

**VISION**

To continue the growth of the classical arts by developing an appreciation for classical dances 

**BRIEF OVERVIEW**

Indian Dance aims to develop a sense of appreciation in pupils towards Indian classical arts. Ranging from P2 to P6, our young dancers learn the various fundamentals of Indian classical dance. They are also trained to express their emotions soulfully not only in classical dance form but also through other styles of dance such as semi classical and modern. Our vibrant dancers participate in many competitions that provide good exposure and opportunities for them to showcase their dancing talents.
