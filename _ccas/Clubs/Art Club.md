**VISION**

An Artistically Renowned Riverlite

**MISSION**

To nurture innovative and artistic Riverlites through the exposure to a variety of art forms.

**OVERVIEW**

The Art Club provides opportunities for Riverlites to experiment with a variety of mediums during the art making process. In Art Club, members learn to use different materials to create dynamic pieces of art and are also exposed to a repertoire of visual arts genres through the creation of 2D and 3D relief artworks.

#### SINGAPORE YOUTH FESTIVAL LOGO DESIGN COMPETITION
------------------------------------------------

  

Ryan Lee Cheng Feng, a primary six art club member, was selected as one of the 16 winners for the Youth Station Project 2019 – Open Call for Original Logo Designs. His efforts were very commendable as he was one out of only two primary school students who were selected as finalists.

“My design focuses on how the arts can enable us to discover new possibilities. Technology is something that has changed the way we make art and connect with people. I wanted to present that idea of different worlds connecting through my logo. In my art lessons or in my CCA, Art Club, I am always intrigued when we are shown examples of Art done by local and non-local artists. I like how the Arts enables us to learn and discover new ways of doing things.” – Ryan Lee Cheng Feng

  

Ryan attended a masterclass with two artists from the design studio, The Workbench. During the masterclass, he learned about the basics of design and was taught how to refine his logo.

This artwork, titled “They eat everything”, was inspired by their knowledge of sea pollution and how marine life is threatened by the trash thrown into the oceans.
