**VISION**

An Artistically Renowned Riverlite

**MISSION**

To nurture innovative and artistic Riverlites through the exposure to a variety of art forms.

**OVERVIEW**

The Art Club provides opportunities for Riverlites to experiment with a variety of mediums during the art making process. In Art Club, members learn to use different materials to create dynamic pieces of art and are also exposed to a repertoire of visual arts genres through the creation of 2D and 3D relief artworks. Through the CCA sessions, students learn to appreciate art, communicate visually and value the role of art in society.
