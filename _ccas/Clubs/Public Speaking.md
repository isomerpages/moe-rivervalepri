**Mission**  

Riverlites will develop oratorical skills and an appreciation of current issues.

**Vision**

Riverlites are eloquent and confident speakers.

**Brief Overview**

Pupils are trained in a wide range of debate topics, techniques and formats. Debate improves critical thinking, argumentation and public speaking skills as pupils learn to think clearly under pressure, analyse complex arguments and speak with confidence. Debate also opens the mind to different points of views and fosters a critical understanding of current affairs.

Debate tournaments/workshops that we participate in:

1)Wits & Words Interschool Debate Championship

2) ACJC Debate Masterclass

3) RI Debate 101 Workshop

4) Primary School Debate Open (PSDO) 

5) Raffles Institution Inter-Primary School Debate Tournament

6) Primary School Open Debate
