**MISSION**

To harness and develop the artistic quality and potential of Riverlites through the Art of Ceramics.

**VISION**

A Riverlite with the love and passion for Visual Arts.

### BRIEF OVERVIEW

The Ceramics Club engages Riverlites by exposing them to the Art of Ceramics. Members of the Ceramics Club get to understand the stages in ceramics process from clay moulding, and sculpting, to glazing and even the firing stage. Each stage harnesses the creativity and imagination in our Riverlites while instilling values of perseverance and positive attitude. Members are also exposed to handbuilding and wheel- throwing skills which develop dexterity and psychomotor skills.

Ceramics also helps to develop Riverlites’ multisensory skills and allows them to express their thoughts and ideas.

Over the years, our Ceramics Club Members had received external recognitions at national level and had achieved numerous awards. Our budding artists get to present their artworks in front of guests and visitors, thus developing our Riverlites into confident and skilled communicators.
