#### MISSION
-------

To develop 21st Century Competencies in Riverlites, such as learning to think logically and critically, communicate and collaborate effectively with peers and innovate with discernment. 

#### VISION
------

  

Inquisitive Riverlites, Active Contributors of our Smart Nation

#### BRIEF OVERVIEW
--------------

  

The Robotics club exposes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) learning to children in their early years. Under the guidance of trained instructors, the club provides an avenue for young inquisitive learners to explore different block-based programming and robotics platforms including Scratch, Hour of Code and LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Classroom. In the process of creation, members question and reflect thoughtfully, collaborate and share their knowledge, and test out their innovative solutions. 

  

As club members experiment with their ideas in a problem-solving process, they also learn and display important core values such as teamwork and resilience that prepare them for the future in this fast-changing world.
