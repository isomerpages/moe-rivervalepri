#### Programme

Our P2 students had a meaningful time solving various open-ended contextual-based mathematical problems. Set in the context of “Mathvengers” who need to save the world by solving problems, students had opportunities to engage in mathematical discourse and practise their numeracy skills. As they handled the challenging mathematical tasks, our P2 students savoured the wonderful experience of solving real-world problems like little mathematicians.
