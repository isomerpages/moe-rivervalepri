### **English Department**


We adopt STELLAR 2.0 approach in the teaching and learning of the English Language. Students are immersed in language learning as they are exposed to various age-appropriate genres. We nurture Riverlites to be confident and effective communicators with&nbsp;**Good Morning, Rivervale! (GMR)**. With this programme, Riverlites are given an opportunity and platform to tell a story, recite poems and share a topic of interest with their schoolmates. Through this programme, the students develop and improve their oral presentation skills whilst boosting their self-confidence.
