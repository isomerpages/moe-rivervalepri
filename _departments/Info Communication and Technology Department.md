Rivervale ICT department spearheads the effort of preparing the school to effectively use technology to engage Riverlites. This is to ensure that Riverlites are equipped with the competency to create, connect and curate information in the digital world. Digital skills are embedded within the curriculum so that students can seamlessly apply skills learned in the various subjects.  
  
At the lower primary, students learn fundamental hardware and software skills to operate the ICT devices. As they progress to higher primary, they will be trained to search for information online and they will be able to complete projects and assignments on various digital platforms, exchanging information digitally while observing proper cyber etiquette.
