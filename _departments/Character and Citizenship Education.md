### **Mission**


To nurture students to demonstrate the values of respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care, harmony, excellence and teamwork.

### **Character and Citizenship Education**


We deliver our Character and Citizenship Education by engaging the Head, the Heart & the Hands.

  

In engaging the **Head**, values are explicitly taught and infused throughout the CCE Curriculum.

  

In engaging the **Heart**, Riverlites will learn to internalise and display National Education (NE) citizenship dispositions and school values.

  

In engaging the **Hands**, students actively participate in Values-in-Action (VIA) projects, to reach out to different people and communities in need.
