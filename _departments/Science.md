### **Science Department**


We nurture our students to have a lively curiosity about things around them and be able to explore, think and express themselves. Programmes to equip students with an inquiring mind as they explore Science include:  
  
1. **E2K Science Programme**: For Primary four and five students who demonstrate interest and ability in science. Through collaborative learning, students practise scientific thinking, develop confidence and independence in carrying out a scientific inquiry.  
  
2. **Science Alive! @ Fun Alley**: With the aim to spark curiosity and interest in students, students get to be involved in activities that engage them hands-on. Students explore fields of Science that are beyond the textbooks!  
  
3. **Our Environment – Recycling**: Our Riverlites commemorate Environment Week and Earth Day by learning more about climate change and how we can play their part in conserving the Earth. Our students learn how to recycle correctly and to manage plastic and waste.
