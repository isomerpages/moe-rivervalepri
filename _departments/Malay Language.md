We nurture Riverlites to have a passion for their Mother Tongue Languages. On top of the regular MT curriculums, Riverlites are given the opportunities to participate in Speech and Drama, Good Morning, Rivervale! (GMR) as well as Mother Tongue Language Fortnight. Through these programmes, we hope to inculcate joy of learning the language and appreciating the culture.
