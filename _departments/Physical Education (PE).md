### **Physical Education Department**


The schoolâ€™s PE programme aims to build a strong foundation in fundamental motor skills which are the essential requirement for positive experiences in sports and games in the upper primary.  
  
The focus for lower primary students is the fundamental motor skills, including locomotor skills, throwing, catching, and kicking. During gymnastics, students also learn to appreciate body movements through the exploration of space.  
  
The highlight for middle primary students is the application of combined skills in small-sided games played within the class.  
The upper primary students are engaged in modified games where they participate as players and as game officials.  
  
Besides the Physical Health component, the PE programme also aims to inculcate school values and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies via games and intra-class competitions.
