Student Management programmes aim to develop Riverlites to be confident leaders and self-disciplined learners.  

  

To develop Riverlites to be self-disciplined learners, we promote ownership with Start it Right (S.I.R.) programme where students pen down their own desired behaviour and accomplishment in school. To help Riverlites achieve the desired outcomes stated by them in the S.I.R contract, we actively cultivate a peer support culture and encourage student feedback through Student Voice programme.

  

We also deploy a three-tiers leadership development programme where we provide opportunities for every Riverlite to assume a leadership role during their time in Rivervale. In addition, we will stretch the students who have demonstrated the ability to lead others with competence and compassion.
