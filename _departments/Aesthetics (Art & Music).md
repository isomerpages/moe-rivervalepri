We aim to develop aesthetically literate Riverlites with the aptitude and attitude through Music and Visual Arts. For Art, we adopt choice-based lessons. With this approach, students are allowed to choose different ways to learn about a particular concept. Having a choice gives students more ownership of their work and allows them to explore different ways of portraying a specific idea or concept.  
  
For Music, once students have acquired the fundamentals in lower primary, they will be exposed to music concepts through the playing of instruments with our Keyboard and Recorder Programmes. At the upper primary level, students will be able to acquire valuable skills that are relevant to the real-world setting through the Garage-band Programme. In this programme, students are introduced to music recording and editing skills which enable them to create and record their own music.
