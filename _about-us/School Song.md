**OUR SCHOOL SONG**

Teachers leading us at Rivervale
Guiding us to succeed and excel
To be positive and humble
Kind and loyal and diligent
To be positive and humble
Loyal and diligent

**Chorus**

\*O Rivervale, O Rivervale
We surely will grow on and on
O Rivervale, O Rivervale
United we are strong

**Chorus**

From our learning we gain wisdom
From serving others, we learn to lead
Keep on Striving always to be the best,
We bring honour to our crest indeed
Keep on Striving always to be the best
Honour to our crest indeed

**Chorus** **(Repeat)**
