**Learning for Life Programme: Dance and Fitness**

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is a MOE initiated programme that exposes students to a wide range of experiences to build their social-emotional competencies and to acquire sound values.

  

**Dance and Fitness** is the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) of Rivervale Primary School. Dance was first recognised as the niche of the school. It was later identified as the LLP of the school in 2014. Formerly known as DANCE FEVER **(D**ance **A**ces **N**urturing **C**ultural **E**xpression **F**or **EVE**ry **R**iverlite), the programme aims at catering to the diverse talents and interests of all Riverlites and to inculcate habits of active lifestyle through dance. The school’s LLP was reviewed and renamed to **Dance and Fitness** to encompass elements of fitness and movement. Further enhancements to the programme included a component on dance-related knowledge to raise awareness of different dance genres as well as to widen students’ perspective of dance during Mass Dance Sessions.

  

This LLP consists of 2 tiers. Tier 1 comprises programmes that cater to the masses. They include mass dance for P1 to 3, P4 multi-cultural dance, P5 Hip Hop and P6 K-Pop dance programmes. Tier 2 caters to select groups of students, mainly the dance CCAs and students who exhibit potential in dance.
