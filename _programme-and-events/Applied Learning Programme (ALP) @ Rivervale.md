Our ALP aims to develop our students to be future-ready by developing their 21st Century Competencies through our Multi-Literacy Programme. Within the programme, students learn to code where they are exposed to computational thinking skills. Literacy lessons are also conducted to expose students to issues in the financial and global landscape. Subsequently students are assigned to projects where they can work collaboratively to creatively solve real-life issues.
