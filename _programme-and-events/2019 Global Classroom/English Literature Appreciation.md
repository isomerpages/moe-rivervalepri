#### Programme
---------

  

Through the story of ‘Giraffe Can’t Dance’, P1 students realised the importance of being resilience when facing difficulty whereas in the story of ‘Paper Bag Prince’, P2 students learnt to differentiate the perspective of a princess and a dragon and thus developing their inferential skills.  The P3 students read a familiar fairy tale ‘The Three Little Pigs’ but the twist of this children’s literature is written from the wolf’s perspective. The feelings of loss, fear and insecurity were explored by the P4 students in the story ‘Into the Forest’ by Anthony Browne. The P5 students were exposed to exploratory thinking via poetry as the teachers made use of SPIRAL, an online platform, to gather responses from the students.
